# Comics
An application to store a comic collection into a database.

New features are currently added in this version. Running this shouldn't crash, but would only be useful to view new functionality.

Main feature being added is the issues box. in the center block of the "Add New Comic" screen. Issues buttons can now be double clicked to open a box for extra info, extra copies and variants.
