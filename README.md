# Comics
An application to store a comic collection into a database.
Using this application as a means to learn object oriented programming and Python in general. 

New features are currently added in this version. Running this shouldn't crash, but would only be useful to view new functionality.

Currently doing some refactoring. Learning to do this earlier, on the hard way.
